## Git Exercise

### Features

The features added implement two different sieves that will return an ordered list of prime numbers. Both sieves take only one argument: `N` which is the upper limit on the primes. That is, both sieves will find all prime number up to (and possibly including) `N`. The two different sieves are:

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes** (in eratosthenes.py)
- **Sieve of Sundaram** (in sundaram.py)
